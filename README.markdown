Development
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is being developed on Networker 7.6.2 on RedHat 5.  I'm using rvm
installed ruby 1.9.2.

It is meant to be run from cron.  It's pretty rough right now, and you probably
don't want to use it without reviewing and understanding the code and what it
does.

Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right now it depends on `redcarpet` and `erubis`.
